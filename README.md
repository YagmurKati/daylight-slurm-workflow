# 🌞 Daylight-Controlled SLURM Workflow (Nextflow)

This repository provides two Nextflow-based workflows designed for the SLURM cluster at **HPC@HU (Humboldt University, Berlin)**. They enable preferential scheduling of **energy-intensive jobs during daylight hours** — either using fixed time windows or dynamically retrieved sunrise/sunset times for Berlin.

✅ The workflows are **portable** and can be adapted to other SLURM-based HPC systems by:
- Editing **latitude/longitude** in `slurm_daylight_automated_scheduler.sh`
- Updating **partition settings** in `nextflow.config`
---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- An account on HU Berlin's HPC system
- Access to the `slurm-login` node
- Nextflow installed on the cluster (`module load nextflow`)
- If using the automated scheduler: `jq` binary available in your home directory (`$HOME/jq`)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 📘 Option 1: Fixed Daylight Window (07:00–19:00)
This uses a static window for daylight. You can modify the `slurm_daylight_scheduler.sh` script to change that range.

```bash
ssh your_username@slurm-login.hpc-service.hu-berlin.de
module load nextflow
chmod +x slurm_daylight_scheduler.sh
nextflow run daylight_controlled_workflow.nf -resume
```
---
### 📗 Option 2: Automatically Fetched Daylight Times (Berlin)

This pulls real-time daylight data for Berlin from an online API.

```bash
ssh your_username@slurm-login.hpc-service.hu-berlin.de
module load nextflow
chmod +x slurm_daylight_automated_scheduler.sh
nextflow run daylight_automated_workflow.nf -resume
```
⚠️ This requires a working copy of jq in your home directory as $HOME/jq.

## ☀️ Daylight-Aware Scheduling

This workflow supports two options for energy-aware job scheduling:

🔹 Option 1: Fixed Daylight Window (slurm_daylight_scheduler.sh)

This script assumes a fixed daylight window between 07:00 and 19:00.
- It checks the current time.
- If the current time is outside the daylight window, it sets a SLURM directive --begin=... to delay the job until 07:00 the next morning.
- If the job cannot run during daylight (e.g., due to cluster load), it will start as soon as resources become available afterward.

This option is simple and lets users easily adjust the daylight window manually in the script if needed.

🔹 Option 2: Dynamic Sunlight Detection (slurm_daylight_automated_scheduler.sh)

This script automatically retrieves the actual sunrise and sunset times for Berlin using the sunrise-sunset.org API.
- It fetches real daylight times based on the current date and location (Berlin: lat=52.52, lng=13.41).
- It adjusts for practical energy use by setting jobs to start 1 hour after sunrise and before 1 hour prior to sunset.
- If the current time is outside this refined daylight window, the script delays the job to the next sunrise period.
- If for some reason the job can't run during daylight (e.g., all nodes busy), it will still run afterward when resources are available.

💡 Use daylight_controlled_workflow.nf with Option 1 (fixed daylight), and daylight_automated_workflow.nf with Option 2 (real sunlight detection).

## 📜 Workflow Overview

This workflow consists of several processes, each assigned to a specific SLURM partition depending on its resource requirements.

| Process Name            | Description                                   | Partition Used  | Notes                                   |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `standard_task`          | Standard task with low resource usage         | `standard`      | Always runs immediately                 |
| `longrun_task`           | Task with extended wall time                  | `longrun`       | Useful for long simulations             |
| `highenergy_std_task`    | CPU-intensive job, prefers daylight           | `standard`      | Daylight-aware via `--begin`             |
| `highenergy_memory_task` | Memory-heavy job, prefers daylight (optional) | `large_memory`  | Disabled by default (optional)          |
| `gpu_task`               | GPU job, prefers daylight (optional)          | `gpu`           | Disabled by default (optional)          |

### Notes:
- Tasks marked as **optional** are initially **commented out** and must be manually enabled.
- Daylight-aware processes will attempt to start between 07:00–19:00 but will still run later if needed.

To enable optional tasks: edit daylight_controlled_workflow.nf or daylight_automated_workflow.nf and uncomment:
```groovy
// highenergy_memory_task(cluster_options_ch)
// gpu_task(cluster_options_ch)
```

---

## ✏️ Customize the Processes

The example processes in this workflow use `sleep 30` as a placeholder.
Replace these with your actual computational tasks or scripts.

For example, in `daylight_controlled_workflow.nf`, change:

```groovy
"""
sleep 30
"""
```

to something like:

```groovy
"""
python run_simulation.py --input params.txt
"""
```

This allows you to adapt the workflow to your real workload while keeping the daylight scheduling logic.

---

## 📦 Output and Work Directory

- All intermediate files and process execution data are stored in the `work/` directory.
- Each job’s SLURM submission script, stdout, stderr, and input/output files are located under a unique hash-named subfolder.

To inspect job details:

```bash
cd work/<unique_hash>/
```

To monitor SLURM jobs:

```bash
squeue
sacct -S today -u your_username
```

## 📥 Getting jq Locally

⚠️ If jq is not available on your system (as is the case on HPC@HU), download it manually:

    wget -O $HOME/jq https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/download/jq-1.6/jq-linux64
    chmod +x $HOME/jq

Make sure it’s executable and referenced as \$HOME/jq in the script. No need to add it to your $PATH.

---

## 🧼 Cleanup

To clean up all intermediate files:

```bash
rm -rf work/ .nextflow/ .nextflow.log
```

---

## 🛠️  Debugging

For additional diagnostics:

```bash
nextflow run daylight_controlled_workflow.nf -resume -with-trace -with-report
```

## 🌞 Why Daylight Scheduling?

Running energy-intensive computing tasks during daylight hours (07:00–19:00) helps reduce the carbon footprint of high-performance computing. This is because the share of solar energy in Germany's electricity supply is much higher during these hours, especially in spring and summer.

In June and July, solar energy production in Germany reaches its yearly peak, according to data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) [1]. For example, Germany generated a record 9 terawatt-hours (TWh) of solar electricity in June 2023 — the highest monthly solar output ever recorded in the country [2].

Carbon-aware scheduling has also been shown to reduce emissions in practice. A scheduling system called S.C.A.L.E., developed at ING and TU Delft, delayed computing jobs to periods of lower grid carbon intensity. This approach reduced the carbon emissions of data pipelines by about 20% [3].
