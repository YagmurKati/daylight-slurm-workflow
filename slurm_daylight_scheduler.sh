# SLURM Daylight Scheduler
# --------------------------------------------
# This script outputs a '--begin=...' SLURM directive
# to delay job start until the next available daylight window (07:00â€“19:00).
#
# If it's already daylight, it allows the job to start immediately.
# If it's outside daylight hours, it delays the job to the next daylight start time.
#
# IMPORTANT: This delay happens only once. If the job is still waiting when daylight ends,
# it will run as soon as resources are available, even outside daylight hours.
# --------------------------------------------

# Get current time as HHMM (e.g., 1045, 1830)
now=$(date +%H%M)

# Define daylight window

daylight_end=1900
